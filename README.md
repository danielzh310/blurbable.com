**Blurbable** is a text-first social space for sharing honest thoughts, everyday moments, and real human experiences. Think LinkedIn without the corporate fluff, Reddit without the noise, and Instagram without the toxicity.

## Our Vision

Blurbable is built for people who want:

* A private-first place to write personal thoughts like a notes app
* The option to share selectively with trusted circles
* A calm alternative to performative social media
* Real human connection without algorithms, AI, or monetization pressure

Blurbable is designed to be small, intentional, and human.

## Core Principles

* **Text-first**: No photos, no links, no external media. Writing is the product.
* **Human-only**: All content is written by real people. No AI, no automation.
* **Low-toxicity by design**: Public spaces are reaction-only. Conversations happen within trusted circles.
* **Privacy and trust**: Users control what is private, shared with circles, or public.
* **No performance incentives**: No followers, no metrics chasing, no algorithms.

## MVP Features

1. **Blurb Posts:** Short text entries written directly into the app.
2. **Privacy Controls:** Blurfs can be private, circle-only, or public.
3. **Reactions:** Lightweight reactions instead of public comment threads.
4. **Circle Replies:** Only people in your circle can reply, privately or in optional threads.
5. **Minimal Profiles:** Simple identity focused on the person, not status or branding.
6. **Verification:** Real people only. Accounts are verified to reduce bots and abuse.
7. **Channels:** Lightweight topic buckets to organize thoughts, not algorithmic feeds.
