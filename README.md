**Blurbable** is where personal notes become shared moments: a quiet, text-first space for real thoughts and real connections.

## Our Vision

Blurbable is built for professionals who want:

* Real human career stories without AI or copy-paste spam
* Short, thoughtful posts (150-250 words)
* A space that balances casual networking with career support

---

## Core Principles

* **Text-first**: No links, no external media. The only image allowed is a profile picture.
* **Authenticity**: All content is human-written, no automation or AI-generated posts.
* **Positive culture**: Reactions are lighthearted and affirming, not negative.
* **Community-led**: Moderation is driven by the members, not algorithms.
